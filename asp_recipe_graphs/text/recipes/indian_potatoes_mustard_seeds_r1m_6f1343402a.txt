id: 6f1343402a

ingredients:
1 teaspoon cumin seed
1 teaspoon brown mustard seeds
1 large onion, finely chopped
3 serrano chilies, split lengthwise
4 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 12 teaspoons ground cumin
1 12 teaspoons ground coriander
12 teaspoon turmeric
salt, to taste
12 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro

instructions:
Heat cumin seeds and mustard seed in hot dry skillet over high heat, swirling pan, until seeds start to pop.
Reduce heat to medium; add onions, chilies, and add a small amount of water; cook until onion is tender, adding more water as necessary to prevent sticking.
Add potatoes, ground cumin, coriander, turmeric, salt (to taste), and cayenne pepper, stirring to mix well.
Add 2/3 cup water, cover, reduce heat and cook for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until spices are absorbed and potatoes are tender.
Add a small amount of water at a time if all liquid evaporates.
Fold in cilantro just before serving.
