id: 822fb5aa43

ingredients:
2 onions (large yellow or white)
12 cup vinegar
23 cup flour
1 teaspoon cumin powder
12 teaspoon turmeric
12 teaspoon chili powder (optional)
1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
1 quart vegetable oil

instructions:
Peel the onions and slice them so they form rings.
Slices should be as thin as possible (1/8 to 3/16").
Cut the rings to form strands about 1-2" long.
Put onion in a large mixing bowl, add spices and salt and mix thoroughlly.
Put about half of the vinegar in and gradually stir in the flour until it is possible to form 1 1/2 to 2" balls with the mixture.
Use flour and remaining vinegar to adjust consistency.
Heat the oil in a suitable deep fryer or pan (careful to avoid overflow when placing food in the oil.
Also have a large water-soaked towel nearby in case of spillage onto the burner).
Heat to 350F.
Form the onion/flour mixture into 1 1/2 to 2" balls and carefully place them in the oil using a metal spoon or suitable tool.
Only fry enough at one time such that they don't stick to eachother.
Fry to dark golden brown.
Remove cooked bhajis from oil and drain as with other fried foods.
Serve on absorbent towel to soak up excess oil.
