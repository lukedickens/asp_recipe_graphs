title:
Onion and Carrot Bhajis

id: 67fc59fa4b

ingredients:
Vegetable oil, for frying
1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup chickpea flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1 garlic clove, minced
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon cayenne
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
3/4 cup yogurt
1 cup thinly sliced onion
1 cup julienned carrots
Salt

instructions:
Heat 2 inches of oil in a wide skillet to 350F.
In a medium bowl, combine the flours, baking soda, ginger, garlic, and the spices.
Stir in the yogurt.
Add just enough water to make a batter the consistency of thickened cream.
In another bowl, mix the onion and carrots, then stir in enough batter to just barely coat the vegetables.
(Test one or two to ensure you have the perfect amount of batter to hold them together.)
Drop by spoonfuls into the hot oil, being careful not to overcrowd the skillet, and cook for 23 minutes, turning once.
Use tongs to give them a gentle squeeze, which helps hold the bhajis together.
Cook for another 34 minutes, until golden.
Remove the bhajis from the oil and drain on paper towels.
Salt lightly.
